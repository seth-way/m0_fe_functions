# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
      I took extra time and care to keep my code clean and choose appropriate names for variables and functions. I'm trying hard to keep this habit.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
      Functions are powerful in their ability to be used and reused thousands of time no matter what the input. This makes programs and websites useful to everyone.
